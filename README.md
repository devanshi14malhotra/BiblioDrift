# 📚 BiblioDrift: Find yourself in the pages.

**BiblioDrift** is a cozy, visual-first book discovery platform designed to make finding your next read feel like wandering through a warm, quiet bookstore rather than scrolling through a database.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy
* **"Zero UI Noise":** No popups, no aggressive metrics. Just calm, immersive browsing.
* **Tactile Interaction:** 3D books that you can pull from the shelf, flip, and inspect.
* **Vibe-First Discovery:** Search for feelings ("rainy mystery"), not just keywords.
* **AI-Native:** Every recommendation is generated by intelligence, ensuring discovery stays organic and scalable.

### 🎨 Immersive Frontend
* **Interactive 3D Books:** Hover to pull from the shelf; click to **Flip** and read the blurb.
* **Apertre UI:** Glassmorphism interface featuring **Scroll-Animated Headers**, **Custom Scrollbars**, and **Dynamic Tooltips**.
* **Visual Polish:** Book Spine Variations and "New" badges for a realistic library feel.
* **Responsive Library:** Realistic wooden shelves that persist via **LocalStorage Sync**.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence
* **Chat with Bookseller:** An integrated AI agent to guide your discovery through natural conversation.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** AI-driven review processing to gauge the emotional tone of other readers.
* **Bookseller Notes:** Dynamic, AI-generated "notes" on book spines powered by our LLM service.
* **Efficiency:** Backend logic includes **AI Response Caching** and **Rate Limiting**.

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure
* **Secure Auth:** Full Authentication Flow with **Secure API Key** management.
* **Hybrid Storage:** Transitioning from LocalStorage to a permanent **PostgreSQL** database sync.
* **Global Metadata:** Powered by the **Google Books API** for real-time data fetching.

## 🤖 AI Recommendation Policy
BiblioDrift follows a **strict AI-only recommendation model**. To ensure discovery stays organic:
1.  **No Manual Curation:** Editor picks, static lists, or hardcoded mappings are strictly prohibited.
2.  **Abstract Signals:** AI must generate suggestions based on **vibes, mood, and emotional tone**.
3.  **Scalability:** All "Bookseller Notes" must be unique and generated dynamically by the AI service.
